# AuctionGame

To add new strategies, create a new subclass of Employee in `employee.py`. Override the `__init__` and `accept_offer`functions to change their behavior. Override the static variable `strategy` to change the name displayed in the graph.

To run a simulation with that strategy, add the class name to the `stratClasses` global constant.
